# How to contribute (from https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Third-party patches are essential for keeping Learnyoureact great. We simply can't
access the huge number of platforms and myriad configurations for running
Puppet. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that
get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.
