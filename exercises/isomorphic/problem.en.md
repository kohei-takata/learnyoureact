Let's use React on the front-end too!

From this excercise on, we'll use React not only on the server side but also on the front-end.
In fact, we'll use the very same view files for rendering both the server-side initial response, and on the front-end for any DOM manipulation necessary. Sharing the code between the front end and the server is a concept known as Isomorphic JavaScript.

In past exercises, there was code that triggered an event in the front-end, but nothing happened. Do you know what it was?

It was interactions with the `checkbox` you wrote in the `State` lesson.
In the `State` lesson, to be honest, checking the `checkbox` doesn't actually update the state.

In this excercise, let's make it update `this.state`, which will require running React on the front-end too.

There is a lot of code to change!

# Question
---

Start by installing the required modules. Run the command below:

```
$ npm install -g browserify babelify babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015
```

Next, create `app.js` in the same directory as `program.js` and copy the code below into it:

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import TodoBox from './views/index.jsx';

let data = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('initial-data').getAttribute('data-json'));
ReactDOM.render(<TodoBox data={data} />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

The above code is to use React on the front-end. This code assumes that there will be some data attached to a DOM element with the id `initial-data`, and passes it into a `TodoBox` from `index.jsx`, and renders the whole component in the element with id `app`.

Next, let's fix `program.js`. You can change your existing one, or make a new `program.js` file and write all the code there.

First of all, let's add some new variables at the top:

```
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server');
var DOM = React.DOM;
var body = DOM.body;
var div = DOM.div;
var script = DOM.script;

var browserify = require('browserify');
var babelify = require("babelify");
```

Next, add a line that `require`s `index.jsx` under the line that `require`s `node-jsx`:

```
require('babel/register');

var TodoBox = require('./views/index.jsx');
```

Finally, fix the routes for `/bundle.js` and `/` as shown below.
When `/bundle.js` is requested, you want to respond with the browserified version of `app.js`, which is transformed to ES5 and will work on the front-end.
When `/` is requested, you want to respond with a combination of `index.jsx` and the server-side data, and `bundle.js`. This renders the initial state of the application on the server, but allows React to run in the client to continue support state changes.

```
app.use('/bundle.js', function (req, res) {
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/javascript');

    browserify("./app.js")
        .transform("babelify", {presets: ["es2015", "react"]})
        .bundle()
        .pipe(res);
});

app.use('/', function (req, res) {
    var initialData = JSON.stringify(data);
    var markup = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(React.createElement(TodoBox, {data: data}));

    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');

    var html = ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(body(null,
        div({id: 'app', dangerouslySetInnerHTML: {__html: markup}}),
        script({
            id: 'initial-data',
            type: 'text/plain',
            'data-json': initialData
        }),
        script({src: '/bundle.js'})
    ));

    res.end(html);
});
```

After writing the necessary code, run `node program.js 3000 Milk 13:00` and access `http://localhost:3000` , and check the real HTML that is outputted.

Click the checkbox some times, and confirm whether you can check the checkbox correctly.

After that, run `learnyoureact verify program.js`.

NOTE: I think some of you might notice  the difference of HTML in which by running `verify` and accessing `http://localhost:3000`.
`data-react-checksum` or  `data-reactid` that keep the DOM unique make the compare of right answer and the code you write fail in the quality.
So if you run `verify`, this code compares the code at other part of HTML.

If you have time, confirm that the checkbox does not work when you set `true` or `false` in `setState` in `handleChange`.
